# Notes and Exercises for CS101

[From udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-computer-science--cs101)

> In this introduction to computer programming course, you’ll learn and practice key computer science concepts by building your own versions of popular web applications. You’ll learn Python, a powerful, easy-to-learn, and widely used programming language, and you’ll explore computer science basics, as you build your own search engine and social network.

It's a pretty good course, which I had it when I started developing. If you've been developing
for a while it will be very useful to practice core concepts.
